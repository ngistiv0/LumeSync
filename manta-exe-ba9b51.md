Manta.exe is an executable file associated with Driver Booster, a software developed by IObit that is designed to help users update and manage their device drivers. The file is part of version 7.0.0.10 of the software and is generally considered safe when downloaded from the official IObit website. However, like many executable files, it can be flagged by antivirus programs if it is located in suspicious directories or if it has been tampered with, leading to potential errors or false positives. Users should ensure they have the latest antivirus software and regularly scan their systems to avoid any unwanted issues. Additionally, if Manta.exe is consuming excessive system resources or causing other errors, it may indicate a problem with the installation or a conflict with other software, in which case reinstalling Driver Booster or checking for updates may help resolve these issues.
